#+title: Aum Emacs

* Motivation: /escape/ from Spacemacs
  
  For years, spacemacs has served me well. I have now realized, however, that it
  has held me from developing further and truly reach the emacs enlightement.

  In the comfort of predefined layers and extensive configuration, I grew lazy.
  This in turn made me use Emacs not as the infinitely-configurable editor that
  is, but as just another commercial editor you install a few plugins and a
  theme in, then change the font and just use it.

  This revelation means that I must embark on a journey into trascendence. May
  RMS guide my lambdas.
