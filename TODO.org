* 1.0 release

  This should serve as my daily driver. At the minimum I would need a rich
  python+conda+ipython IDE; feature-rich document production suite with
  markdown, pandoc, LaTeX and Org; code project management via magit, projectile
  and persp; snippets (yasnippet), powerful code navigation (ivy etc)

  Nice-to have: fully configured term (elisp or other), richly configured dired
  (possibly sunrise commander), mu4e. Also things like multi-cursors.
  Hydras and keybindings are not considered essential for 1.0, the idea is to
  add that kind of functionality over time.
